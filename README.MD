# capacitor-firebase-auth

Capacitor plugin for Firebase Authentication that handle the authentication on Native layer and propagate the token to the web view layer. After the sign-in process completes, the user will be signed in within both tiers.

Authenticating on the native layer is useful if you have another plugin that also needs authentication. But even if you don't need it, it does not negatively affect performance.

The plugin supports Google, Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Phone providers in Android, iOS and Web.

## Important notes for upgrading between minor or major versions.

#### from 2.x.y to 2.4.x
> Use of Firebase ^8.0.0
> Please, for a while read the instructions on issues #128.
> This is the last release before Capacitor 3.

#### from 2.2.x to 2.3.x
> Requires Capacitor Framework v2.2.1 or newer. This is another episode of the Capacitor Framework braking changes 
> on Android platform (com.getcapacitor.Config, now com.getcapacitor.CapConfig).

> Really sorry about braking changes in minor release, but I want to follow major version of the Capacitor Framework. 

#### from 2.0.x to 2.2.x 
> You need to use version 2.2.0 of the Capacitor Framework due braking changes on Android platform (com.getcapacitor.Config)

#### from 0.3.x to 2.0.0
> Sorry about that, but there is no path to do it, I my case, me and my team decided to re-build the projects from scratch, this does not mean code 
> rewrite, just a project, configurations and build. The good news is, there is no change on Typescript/Javascript/Java/Swift facades.

> Anyway, you can make a try with Capacitor Framework update instructions:
>[From <= 1.5.1 to 2.0.0](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/updating#from-1-5-1-to-2-0-0)

#### from 0.2.x to 0.3.0: esModuleInterop

> The firebase import was changed using `esModuleInterop`, that was a [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) requirements, please see issue [#38](https://github.com/baumblatt/capacitor-firebase-auth/issues/38).

```
1 import * as firebase from 'firebase/app';
         ~~~~~~~~
    8601 export = firebase;
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This module is declared with using 'export =', and can only be used with a default import when using the 'allowSyntheticDefaultImports' flag.
```
If you see the message above, please use `esModuleInterop=true` in your  `tsconfig.json` file.

#### from 0.1.x to 0.2.0: GoogleSignIn 5.0.0
> Required GoogleSignIn 5.0.0 on iOS platform, run `pod update` if using lower version.


## Next steps

1. Test for Apple provider for Android
2. Apple provider for Web
3. Link social accounts
4. Email/Password Provider

> Should we do this? It's very simple to authenticate on WebView without any plugin. 
> For awhile, waiting a good reason to do it. (track interest on Issue #24)

### How to Install

Install the plugin into your Capacitor project with npm.

```
npm install --save capacitor-firebase-auth
```

> Don't forget to run `npx cap sync` once after the installation to propagate the plugin to native projects. 
 
### How to Config

### The minimal version of some peer dependencies that breaks with previous versions

- FBSDKCoreKit 5.0.0 (see issue #12)
- FBSDKLoginKit 5.0.0 (see issue #12)
- GoogleSignIn 5.0.0 (see issue #14 and #15)

## Capacitor Plugins

1. In file `capacitor.config.json` config the providers list, language code and native authentication as desired
    ```
    [...]
      "plugins": {
        "CapacitorFirebaseAuth": {
          "providers": ["google.com", "twitter.com", "facebook.com", "phone"],
          "languageCode": "en",
          "nativeAuth": false,
          "properties": {
            "google": {
                "hostedDomain": "my-custom-domain.com"
            }
          },   
          "permissions": {
               "google": ["profile", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive", ...]
           }
        }
      }
    [...]
    ```
   > Note: `nativeAuth` is a feature supported for Google, Twitter and Facebook (not Phone or Apple) to sign the user on the native layer too.
   >> This is useful if you need to handle any feature provided by another plugin that needs authentication.
    
   > Note 2: Don't forget to remove `hosted domain` properties from Google SignIn in case you don't need it. 
   > See more [here](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/api/signin/GoogleSignInOptions.Builder#parameters_6)
   > about this feature.

2. In file `android/app/src/main/java/.../MainActivity.java` add the reference to the Capacitor Firebase Auth plugin inside the Bridge initialization.
    ```
    [...]
    import com.baumblatt.capacitor.firebase.auth.CapacitorFirebaseAuth;
    // Initializes the Bridge
    this.init(savedInstanceState, new ArrayList<Class<? extends Plugin>>() {{
      // Additional plugins you've installed go here
      // Ex: add(TotallyAwesomePlugin.class);
      add(CapacitorFirebaseAuth.class);
    }});
    [...]
    ```
    
3. For Typescript users, please, review your `tsconfig.json` and ensure that you are using `esModuleInterop=true`.

## Firebase

1. Follow instructions to add Firebase to your native project:
    * [Add Firebase to your Android project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
    * [Add Firebase to your iOS project ](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
2. If you haven't yet connected your app to your Firebase project, do so from the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Please, don't forgot your Google Service _.json_ or _.plist_ file or your app will crash on the startup.

#### Extra steps for iOS

1. Add a URL scheme to your project (iOS only)

    * Click the **+** button, and add a `URL scheme` for your reversed client ID. To find this value, open the `GoogleService-Info.plist` configuration file, and look for the `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` key. Copy the value of that key, and paste it into the **URL Schemes** box on the configuration page. Leave the other fields blank.

## Phone

#### Google iOS specific configurations
Since that Apple using Push Notification service (APNs). You need to have `.p8` key and upload to project FCM config to use phone login or you will get this [Error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45091583/invalid-token-when-trying-to-authenticate-phone-number-using-firebase). Do so from the [Settings page](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/cloudmessaging/) of the Firebase console.

    * Then, make sure your **OAuth redirect URI** (e.g. _my-app-12345.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler_) is listed as one of your OAuth redirect URIs in your Facebook app's settings page on the  [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) site in the **Product Settings** > **Facebook Login** config.

#### Facebook Android specific configurations 

1. Add the dependency for **Facebook SDK** to your app-level build.gradle file:
    ```
    implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:5.15.3'
    ```
2. In file `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following XML elements under `<manifest><application>` :
   
   ```xml
   <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId"
       android:value="@string/facebook_app_id"/>
   
   <activity
       android:name="com.facebook.FacebookActivity"
       android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation"
       android:label="@string/app_name" />
   
   <activity
       android:name="com.facebook.CustomTabActivity"

   ```
   
3. In file `android/app/src/main/res/values/ids.xml` add the following lines :
    ```xml
    <string name="facebook_app_id">[APP_ID]</string>
    <string name="fb_login_protocol_scheme">fb[APP_ID]://authorize</string>
    ```
    > Don't forget to replace `[APP_ID]` by your Facebook **App ID**.

#### Facebook iOS specific configurations

1. Add your your `[APP_ID]` and `[APP_NAME]` keys in the file `ios/App/App/Info.plist`.

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        [...]
        <key>FacebookAppID</key>
        <string>[APP_ID]</string>

   * Click the **+** button, and add a `URL` scheme for the Callback URL of Facebook Kit for iOS. In **URL Schemes** box on the configuration page use `fb[APP_ID]`. Leave the other fields blank.

3. Add the pods that you want to install. You can include a Pod in your Podfile like this:

    ```
    target 'App' do
      capacitor_pods
      # Add your Pods here
        pod 'Firebase/Core'
        pod 'Firebase/Auth'
        pod 'FBSDKCoreKit'
        pod 'FBSDKLoginKit'
    end
    ```

4. Dispatch the designated callback URL to Facebook Kit in your `ios/App/App/AppDelegate.swift` file.

    Facebook SDK
    ```
      import FBSDKCoreKit
    
      ...
    
      func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        // Called when the app was launched with a url. Feel free to add additional processing here,
        // but if you want the App API to support tracking app url opens, make sure to keep this call
        
        if let scheme = url.scheme, let host = url.host {
            if scheme == "fb\(String(describing: Settings.appID))" && host == "authorize" {
                return ApplicationDelegate.shared.application(app, open: url, options: options)
            }
        }
        
        return CAPBridge.handleOpenUrl(url, options)
      }
    ```


> Don't forget to replace `[APP_ID]` and `[APP_NAME]` by your Facebook **App ID** and **App Name** respectively.

## Apple

#### Apple global configurations 
1. Follow carefully sections: 
[Before you begin](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/apple#before-you-begin), 
[Join the Apple Developer Program](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/apple#join-the-apple-developer-program) and
[Configure Sign In with Apple](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/apple#configure_sign_in_with_apple)
of Firebase docs.

2. Enable Apple as a sign-in provider, in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), open the Auth section. On the Sign in method tab, enable the Apple provider. If you are only using Sign In with Apple in an iOS app, you can leave the Service ID, Apple Team ID, private key and key ID fields empty.

#### Apple Android configurations

1. Follow carefully sections:
[Configure Sign In with Apple](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/apple?authuser=0#configure-sign-in-with-apple)
 
#### Apple iOs configurations 
No additional configurations are required by this plugin.

> Don't forget to enable ```Apple Sign In``` capability for your App on Xcode.

## Usage

#### Sign in

```typescript
import {User} from 'firebase/app'
import {cfaSignIn} from 'capacitor-firebase-auth';

cfaSignIn('google.com').subscribe(
	(user: User) => console.log(user.displayName);
)
```

#### Sign in mapping User to UserInfo
```typescript
 import {cfaSignIn, mapUserToUserInfo} from 'capacitor-firebase-auth';
 import {UserInfo} from 'firebase/app';
 
 cfaSignIn('google.com').pipe(
 	mapUserToUserInfo(),
 ).subscribe(
    (user: UserInfo) => console.log(user.displayName)
 )
```

#### Sign out

```typescript
import {cfaSignOut} from 'capacitor-firebase-auth';

//[...]

cfaSignOut().subscribe()
```

#### Phone Verification

```typescript
import {cfaSignInPhone} from 'capacitor-firebase-auth';

cfaSignInPhone('+16505551234').subscribe((user) => {
  console.log(user.phoneNumber)
})
```

> On iOS platform the observable will complete without emit (like EMPTY), follow the notifications below to sign on Firebase on Web Layer.

#### Notification for Phone Verification step

```typescript
import {
  cfaSignInPhoneOnCodeSent,
  cfaSignInPhoneOnCodeReceived,
  cfaSignInPhoneOnCodeAutoRetrievalTimeOut
} from 'capacitor-firebase-auth';

// [...]

// Android and iOS
cfaSignInPhoneOnCodeSent()
  .subscribe((verificationId) => {
    console.log(verificationId)
  })

// Android Only
cfaSignInPhoneOnCodeReceived()
  .subscribe((event: {verificationId: string, verificationCode: string}) => {
    console.log(`${event.verificationId}:${event.verificationCode}`)
  })

cfaSignInPhoneOnCodeReceived()
  .pipe(switchMap(() => { cfaSignInPhoneOnCodeAutoRetrievalTimeOut() }))
  .subscribe((verificationId) => {
    console.log(verificationId)
  })

```

Suggestion for web authentication code to iOS, the `verificationCode` must be provided by the user, please see [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/phone-auth#sign-in-the-user-with-the-verification-code) for more information.
```typescript

import firebase from 'firebase/app';

const credential = firebase.auth.PhoneAuthProvider.credential(verificationId, verificationCode);

firebase.auth().signInWithCredential(credential);
```

## Alterantive use of Javascript facade

This implementations of the javascript facade calls, return in addition to the Firebase user 
the information returned by the plugin from the native layer. For example, in Twitter sign in
the token and secret are returned for use with Twitter User API. 

> Specials thanks for [@go-u](https://github.com/go-u), by this suggested improvement, more information please see issue [#23](https://github.com/baumblatt/capacitor-firebase-auth/issues/23)!

#### Sign in

```typescript
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import {cfaSignIn, SignInResult} from 'capacitor-firebase-auth/alternative'; import {SignInResult} from './definitions';

cfaSignIn('twitter.com').subscribe(
	({userCredential, result}: {userCredential: firebase.auth.UserCredential, result: SignInResult}) => {
		console.log(userCredential.user.displayName);
		console.log(result) // will print (providerId, idToken and secret)
	}
)
```

#### Sign In using direct twitter method

```typescript
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import {cfaSignInTwitter, TwitterSignInResult} from 'capacitor-firebase-auth/alternative'; import {SignInResult} from './definitions';

cfaSignInTwitter().subscribe(
	({userCredential, result}: {userCredential: firebase.auth.UserCredential, result: TwitterSignInResult}) => {
		console.log(userCredential.user.displayName);
		console.log(result.idToken)
	}
)
```

#### Sign In;  Use credentials for something; and map to UserInfo

```typescript
import {UserInfo} from 'firebase/app'; 
import {cfaSignInTwitter, TwitterSignInResult, mapUserCredentialToUserInfo} from 'capacitor-firebase-auth/alternative'; 
import {tap} from 'rxjs/operators';

cfaSignInTwitter().pipe(
    tap(({result}:{result: TwitterSignInResult}) => console.log(result.idToken)),
    mapUserCredentialToUserInfo(),
).subscribe(
	(user: UserInfo) => console.log(user.displayName)
)
```

## Known limitations

#### Phone Verification

The user will be **signed in** only in web layer. This limitation is due to the **verification code** only works once. So, there is no way to authenticate the user in both layers (native and web) with just one SMS Code.
